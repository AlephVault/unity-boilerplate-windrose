# A WindRose boilerplate for Unity

This is a boilerplate project. It includes WindRose and all the required dependencies, and will be tagged with local or specific versions of those dependency packages.

Unity version
-------------

The current status is meant to be used in Unity 2020.3 or better. The upper version is not yet determined, and lower versions are not supported (i.e. it may work, but with no responsibilities from the development side).

Dependencies versioning and status
----------------------------------

So far this project relies on a set of packages that I could consider, at best, in beta status. These packages are not officially released and they are tagged 0.0.1. The referenced packages exist into this organization and must be cloned individually besides this boilerplate (i.e. as a sibling directory). They are:
